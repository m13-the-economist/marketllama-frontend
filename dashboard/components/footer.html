        <strong>⚠️ Risk Disclaimer:</strong><br><br>
        Trading in financial markets carries inherent risks, including the potential for loss of capital.
        Performance may vary based on market conditions, account size, risk tolerance, and execution
        environment. While Market Llama is built to deliver consistent, data driven performance through
        advanced automation and professional account management, no trading environment is completely
        without risk.
        <br><br>
        Users should understand that smaller accounts face higher exposure to volatility, faster drawdown
        cycles, and reduced margin flexibility compared to larger accounts. Larger accounts can withstand
        market fluctuations more effectively, but they are still subject to market risk and temporary
        performance deviations.
        <br><br>
        Market Llama operates as a technology-enabled, professional account management platform similar
        to institutional asset managers providing users with sophisticated trading systems, automated
        execution, and real-time risk controls. Our purpose is to optimize performance, protect user
        capital, and deliver institutional-grade trading outcomes.
        <br><br>
        By connecting your trading account to Market Llama, you acknowledge that every investment activity
        carries risk, and that results can vary across market conditions. We commit to operating
        transparently, managing accounts responsibly, and applying disciplined, data driven strategies
        designed to achieve consistent long-term performance.
